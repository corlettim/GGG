Since our checks have minute details, it is vital that our users understand
just exactly how to make them.

### There are two kinds of tags.
1. The first is a required tag which can be self
explanatory. A required tag will be displayed in the example of checks by the
all capital letters. Required arguments must accompany the check that they are
connected with.
2. The second kind of tag is an optional tag. Optional tags let you personalize
the checks to target exactly what you are asking your students to do. Consequently,
it is not necessary that you use the optional tags but they are there is you wish.
Optional tags are marked in the examples by square brackets.

## Listed below will be explanations of what each individual tag means or is asking.
# The required tags:
- FILE: the name of the file that you want checked.
- DIR: the name of the directory you want checked.
- COMMAND: the command that you want to check.
- COUNT: the number that must be met.
- FRAG: the fragment, in quotations, that you want to be checked.
# The optional tags
- [-h]: attached to the end of your check for help if necessary
- [--exact]: if you want one of your required tags to be exact; usually accompanied
with the COUNT tag.
- [--reach]: accompanies a check if they are not required to be completed but
urge the student to try and "reach" the next step in the assignemnt.
