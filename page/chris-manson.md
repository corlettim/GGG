Hannah, Alex, and Megan are students at Allegheny College. Inspired by the world
around them, they took on the challenge of becoming Computer Science majors. As
a way to grow and develop in their coding abilities, they were presented with
the idea of joining the GatorGrader team and developing code for the automated
testing tool. A semester later, they are the lead software engineers on this
project and have devoted time to creating a website that will allow people to
better understand GatorGrader.
